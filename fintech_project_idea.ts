// Server-side implementation

// Import required packages
import express from 'express';
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

// Set up the express app
const app: express.Application = express();
const port: number = 3000;

// Connect to the MongoDB database
const uri: string = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const client: MongoClient = new MongoClient(uri, { useUnifiedTopology: true });

// Middleware for parsing JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// API endpoints for handling user authentication, account integration, and finance tracking

// GET endpoint to retrieve user's account balances
app.get('/api/accounts/:userId/balances', async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve user's account balances from the Plaid API or local database
  // ...
  res.json({ balances });
});

// GET endpoint to retrieve user's transaction history
app.get('/api/accounts/:userId/transactions', async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve user's transaction history from the Plaid API or local database
  // ...
  res.json({ transactions });

This is a TypeScript code snippet for the server-side implementation of a personal finance tracker web application. It includes setting up an Express.js server, connecting to a MongoDB database, and defining API endpoints for handling user authentication, account integration, and finance tracking functionalities. The application integrates with the Plaid API for retrieving account balances, transaction history, and categorizing expenses. It also allows users to set budgets for different expense categories. The code is written in TypeScript for type safety and leverages various libraries and tools such as React, Chart.js, React Router, and Material UI for the front-end implementation.
