// Deploy the LendingPlatform contract
async function deployContract() {
    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();  // Connect to a local Ethereum node
    const signer = provider.getSigner();

    const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(LendingPlatformContract, signer);

}

deployContract();
```

This TypeScript code defines a LendingPlatform contract and provides a function to deploy the contract on a local Ethereum node. The LendingPlatform contract allows users to request a loan by providing the loan amount, interest rate, and duration. Each loan request is stored in a mapping, and an event is emitted when a loan is requested.

The contract can be further extended to support loan approval, repayment, and other functionalities typically required in a lending platform.
