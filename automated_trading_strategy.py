This code sets up an automated trading strategy using the CCXT library in Python. It connects to the Binance exchange using API credentials and continuously fetches the latest ticker data for the BTC/USDT trading pair. Based on the current price, it executes buy or sell orders using market orders. The trading logic in this example is simple - it buys Bitcoin if the price goes above $50,000 and sells Bitcoin if the price goes below $45,000. The strategy runs in an infinite loop with a 1-minute interval between each iteration.
